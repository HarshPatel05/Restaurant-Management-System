### **How to Run Locally (Frontend Only)**

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshPatel05/Panda-Express-Multi-View-Website-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project folder**
    ```bash
    cd Panda-Express-Multi-View-Website-System
    ```

3. **Navigate to the expressNEW folder:**
    ```bash
    cd expressNEW
    ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Open the application:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to view the app.


7. **Access each page directly by URL:**
   Since the database is no longer accessible, the login will not work. You can still preview each view by manually visiting these routes:
   - Login View: [http://localhost:5000/index](http://localhost:5000/index)
   - Register View: [http://localhost:5000/register](http://localhost:5000/register)
   - Manager View: [http://localhost:5000/manager](http://localhost:5000/manager)
   - Kiosk View: [http://localhost:5000/kiosk](http://localhost:5000/kiosk)
   - Kitchen View: [http://localhost:5000/kitchen](http://localhost:5000/kitchen)
   - Menu Board(Main Menu): [http://localhost:5000/menuboard](http://localhost:5000/menuboard)
   - Special Menu Board(Seasonal Items): [http://localhost:5000/specialboard](http://localhost:5000/specialboard)

### **Important Note About Database Access:**
The backend was originally connected to a PostgreSQL database hosted by our university. We no longer have access to this database. As a result:
- Login and any actions that require database interaction (e.g., placing orders, updating menu items) will not work.
- You can still explore the frontend pages by visiting the routes listed in step 7.
